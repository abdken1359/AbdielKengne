            <h1>A Glimpse into my personality</h1>
            <p>I'm a self-taught frontend web developer and graphic designer with a passion for crafting thoughtful digital experiences. Currently in junior high school, Iâ€™ve been independently learning modern web technologies like Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS, along with visual design tools like Canva. I enjoy blending creativity with code to build clean, responsive, and user-focused interfaces. My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer while continuing to explore UI/UX design and brand identity. I'm always curious, always learning, and excited about what comes next.
